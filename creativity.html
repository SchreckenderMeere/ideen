        <div class="columns">Thing is, I do not know. I do not know anything about all the chemical reactions in my brain or in anyone elses brain. I am as confused as you are or might be. I know, that sometimes my creativity or "creative process" gets limited by resources or some restrictions that were made by someone. <br>
        But shouldnt a creative person be able to overcome those rules and make the best thing out of it somehow? I once read, that so called "creative individuals" actually seek problems - perhaps problems or opportunities that no one else recognizes - and pose unique questions. In the process of solving those obstacles, they find comfort. Mabe that is true. I don´t know. What I know, is that I like pursuing my goals. It is and always has been a necessity in my life and indeed brings me satisfaction. Getting lost in finding and implementing ideas, to overcome certain difficulties and being able to present something in the end is a nice thing but there has to be more about creativity than that.
       <br>
        
        
        Maybe creativity is the process we go through while inventing and formulating ideas. Maybe it is about all the tiny things we change during the process of building, drawing, writing, inventing, designing, calculating...
        I don´t know, but it could be true. Referring to creativity as a process makes sence to me.
        <br>
        
       You maybe begin your creative journey with someone telling you what they want and then start thinking.
        What does the person want? How can I imply their vision with my ideas? What material do they give me to work with? How can I change things? What do I want? What do I want to do?
      <br>
        
         I don´t know. You wait until one idea you had and wrote down comes to your likings. But there is nothing. Just the endless void of your mind telling you that there is nothing  good enough. So eventually you start procrastinating. You get frustrated because nothing works the way you want it to work and the deadline gets closer and closer.<br> 
            
            I actually enjoy that feeling of pressure, because if no one else kicks my ass, then time definetly will.
